# Validate Subsequence
## Given two non-empty arrays of integers, our goal is to write a function that establishes whether the second array is a valid subsequence of the first array. A valid subsequence of an array is classified as a set of numbers that aren’t necessarily adjacent in the array but are in the same order as they appear in the array. For example, [2, 5, 6] and [2, 6] are both considered as valid subsequences of the array [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It is also important to note that [2] and [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] are both valid subsequences of the array.

### Example

```swift
Input array → [3, 6, 23, 7, 2, 4]

Sequence → [3, 7, 4]

Output → True
```
